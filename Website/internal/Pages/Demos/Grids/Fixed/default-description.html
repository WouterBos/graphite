<p>The fixed grid is pretty much what you would expect from frameworks like <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> and the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a>. The only thing is that, since Graphite is based on .Less, the grid is configurable. The grid is by default set to 16 columns in a viewport that's 960 pixels wide. But these values are not vixed, but stored in variables that can be set in gp_values.less.</p>
